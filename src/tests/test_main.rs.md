 This code appears to be a Rust implementation of a command-line tool for managing a monitoring system that includes Graphana (likely for visualizing data) and possibly other components. Here's an overview of the main functionalities provided:

1. **Monitoring System Commands**: The script defines the following commands for the monitoring system:
   - `status`: prints the status of the monitoring system (running or not).
   - `start`: starts the monitoring system.
   - `stop`: stops the monitoring system.
   - `check`: checks if the monitoring system is running.
   - A `--docker` flag can be added to any of these commands to enable Docker-based components (Grafana, etc.) when starting/checking the monitoring system.

2. **Docker Commands**: The script includes functions for managing Docker components of the monitoring system:
   - `start_docker`: starts the Docker-based components of the monitoring system.
   - `stop_docker`: stops the Docker-based components of the monitoring system.
   - `check_docker`: checks if the Docker-based components of the monitoring system are running.

3. **Error Handling and Logging**: The script uses a custom logging function with different severity levels like `info`, `warning`, and `error`. Additionally, it includes error handling using Rust's `Result` type to manage any errors that might occur during execution.

4. **Progress Indicator**: A simple progress indicator is used for long-running tasks (e.g., starting/stopping Docker components) to inform the user about the task status.

Overall, this script seems like a useful tool for managing a monitoring system with Docker components more easily from the command line.
