# qitops-agent

> This is the beginning of an open-source QA Agent powered by the QitOps philosophy.

## 🌟 What is qitops-agent?

`qitops-agent` is an intelligent assistant for modern QA professionals. It's designed to augment, not replace, the judgment, creativity, and strategy of human testers.

Born from the QitOps vision — where QA is continuous, embedded, intelligent, and human-first — this agent is part tooling, part philosophy, and part community-powered evolution.

The agent will help testers:
- Plan smarter tests
- Understand what to test and why
- Automate test design without losing intentionality
- Catch risk early in the development cycle
- Learn through doing and reflecting

## 🎓 Why is this also a Capstone Project?

This project is also a capstone for learners of QitOps Learn, our QA career development platform. Contributors will:
- Apply AI + QA skills in a real-world codebase
- Collaborate on scoped, meaningful tasks
- Build a public portfolio of impactful, next-gen QA work

## ✨ Key Features (MVP Scope)

- **🧠 Test Case Generation**
  - From user stories, feature specs, or code diffs
  - Output: YAML, Gherkin, Robot Framework

- **🔍 Risk Detection**
  - Analyzes PRs and diffs for high-risk changes
  - Suggests where QA should focus

- **🛠️ Test Strategy Assistant**
  - Suggests test types, techniques, and heuristics
  - Based on system type, domain, or context

- **🗣️ Exploratory Testing Aid**
  - Recommends next test ideas based on notes and findings

- **📊 Test Data Generator**
  - Structured, edge-case rich data generation (JSON, forms, inputs)

- **💬 Explainable Output**
  - Shows reasoning, confidence scores, and flags hallucinations

## 🤝 Philosophy & Principles

- **Augment, not replace** testers
- **Explain over guess** — show your work, model
- **Respect the spectrum** of QA disciplines
- **Pluggable + composable** architecture
- **Local-first friendly** — Ollama and open-source LLMs supported
- **Feedback loops > automation loops**

## 🛤️ Roadmap (High-Level)

- [ ] Initial CLI with local LLM + YAML generator
- [ ] GitHub PR context + risk analysis prototype
- [ ] Plugin architecture design
- [ ] Web UI (optional) / VS Code extension
- [ ] Contrib-friendly starter templates (prompt chains, plugins)

## 🧑‍🎓 Who Should Contribute?

- Testers (manual, automation, exploratory)
- AI tinkerers and prompt engineers
- LLM devs and ML hobbyists
- DevTools & CLI lovers
- Learners from QitOps Learn

If you're curious, thoughtful, and want to shape the future of QA — you're welcome here.

## 📚 Inspiration

- The QitOps philosophy
- Testing heuristics, risk-based testing
- The strengths (and limitations) of AI tooling
- Dev-first and human-centric workflows
