# qitops-agent

**The QitOps Agent** is an open-source AI-powered QA Assistant — built as the capstone project of [QitOps Learn](https://qitops.dev), and a flagship initiative of the QitOps testing philosophy.

It represents the culmination of a vision: to reimagine Quality Assurance not as an afterthought or gatekeeper, but as an **embedded, intelligent, human-centered force for stability, trust, and creativity in software development**.

## 🧠 What is the QitOps Agent?

The QitOps Agent is a modular, evolving AI assistant that helps testers, SDETs, and QA engineers:

- Plan smarter test strategies
- Generate meaningful test cases
- Analyze pull requests and surface risks
- Assist with exploratory and session-based testing
- Review flaky test histories and offer insights
- Support test data creation and edge-case scenarios
- Operate transparently, with explainability and human-in-the-loop confidence scores

This is more than just a tool — it’s a living expression of the QitOps methodology.
