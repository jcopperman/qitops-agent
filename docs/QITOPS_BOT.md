QitOps Bot: To generate test cases, you can use the `test-gen` command:

qitops run test-gen --path <file_or_directory> [options]

Options:
- --path: Path to the source code (required)
- --format: Output format (markdown, yaml, robot) [default: markdown]
- --sources: Sources to use (comma-separated)
- --personas: Personas to use (comma-separated)

Example:
qitops run test-gen --path src/auth.js

Would you like to know more about any of these options?
```

### Executing Commands

```
You: !exec run test-gen --path src/auth.js --format yaml

QitOps Bot: I executed the command: `run test-gen --path src/auth.js --format yaml`

### Getting Help with Configuration

```
You: How do I set up environment variables for sources?

QitOps Bot: To set up environment variables for sources, you can use the following format:

For Windows (PowerShell):
$env:QITOPS_SOURCES = "requirements:requirements:docs/requirements.md:Project requirements,standards:standard:docs/standards.md:Coding standards"

For Linux/macOS:
export QITOPS_SOURCES="requirements:requirements:docs/requirements.md:Project requirements,standards:standard:docs/standards.md:Coding standards"

You can also set up individual sources:

For Windows (PowerShell):
$env:QITOPS_SOURCE_REQUIREMENTS = "requirements:docs/requirements.md:Project requirements"

For Linux/macOS:
export QITOPS_SOURCE_REQUIREMENTS="requirements:docs/requirements.md:Project requirements"

Would you like to know more about environment variables for QitOps Agent?

### Learning About PR Analysis

```
You: What is PR analysis and how do I use it?

QitOps Bot: PR analysis is a feature of QitOps Agent that analyzes pull requests for potential issues, including:

- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance concerns
- Code quality issues
- Compliance with requirements and standards
- Test coverage gaps

To analyze a PR, you can use the `pr-analyze` command:

qitops run pr-analyze --pr <pr_number_or_url> [options]

Examples:

1. Analyze a PR by number:
   qitops run pr-analyze --pr 123

2. Analyze a PR by URL:
   qitops run pr-analyze --pr https://github.com/username/repo/pull/123

3. Analyze with specific personas:
   qitops run pr-analyze --pr 123 --personas security-analyst

The analysis results will include potential issues, recommendations, and suggested improvements.
```

### Getting Help with Source Management

```
You: How do I manage sources in QitOps?

QitOps Bot: In QitOps Agent, sources provide context for AI-powered generation. You can manage sources using the `source` command:

1. Add a source:
   qitops source add --id requirements --type requirements --path docs/requirements.md --description "Project requirements"

2. List all sources:
   qitops source list

3. Show source content:
   qitops source show --id requirements

4. Remove a source:
   qitops source remove --id requirements

Sources can be used with various commands by specifying the `--sources` option:

qitops run test-gen --path src/auth.js --sources requirements,standards

You can also set default sources using environment variables or configuration files as we discussed earlier.

Would you like to know more about source types or how to use sources effectively?
```

### Troubleshooting Issues

```
You: I'm getting an error "Source not found: requirements" when running test-gen

QitOps Bot: This error occurs when QitOps Agent can't find a source with the ID "requirements". Here are some steps to troubleshoot:

1. Check if the source exists by listing all sources:
   qitops source list

2. If the source doesn't exist, add it:
   qitops source add --id requirements --type requirements --path docs/requirements.md

3. Make sure the source file exists at the specified path:
   ls docs/requirements.md

4. If you're using environment variables, check that they're set correctly:
   echo $QITOPS_SOURCES  # Linux/macOS
   echo $env:QITOPS_SOURCES  # Windows PowerShell

5. Try running the command with verbose output to see more details:
   qitops -v run test-gen --path src/auth.js --sources requirements

Let me know if you need help with any of these steps!
```
